# Tools

Tools to make development of this repo easier. There are already a few bash scripts living in `scripts/`, but this directory is for larger projects with more use cases... and maybe that's dumb and will change, who knows.

# Ideas

Doesn't matter how they're built, but these are things that would be nice to have.

* [ ] single command to populate local DB with a bunch of random test data; minimal options such as 'random between 2-8 deals per location, random up to 25 locations'.

* [ ] Easy interface to create specific single item or a couple items in local DB.  Could have defaults for any fields that weren't given so you only have to care about the ones you're testing.
